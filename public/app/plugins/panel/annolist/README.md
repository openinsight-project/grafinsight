# Annotation List Panel -  Native Plugin

This Annotations List panel is **included** with GrafInsight.

However, it is presently in alpha and is not accessible unless alpha panels are [enabled in GrafInsight settings](https://grafinsight.com/docs/grafinsight/latest/administration/configuration/#enable_alpha)
